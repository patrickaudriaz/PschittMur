## Project Structure

- `src/` - Frontend Vue application
  - `components/` - Vue components
  - `views/` - Vue views/pages
  - `stores/` - Pinia stores for state management
  - `router/` - Vue Router configuration
  - `services/` - API services
  - `assets/` - Static assets like styles and images
- `server/` - Backend Express application
  - `index.js` - Express server and MongoDB connection
  - `package.json` - Server dependencies

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - Vue 3 with Composition API
  - Vite for fast development
  - Vue Router for routing
  - Pinia for state management
  - SCSS for styling
  - Axios for API requests
  - LocalStorage for fallback data persistence

- **Backend**:
  - Express.js for the API server
  - MongoDB for database storage
  - Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling

## Data Persistence

The application uses a multi-layered approach to data persistence:

1. **Primary Storage**: MongoDB database via the backend API
2. **Fallback Storage**: LocalStorage in the browser

If the MongoDB connection fails, the application will automatically fall back to using LocalStorage, ensuring that users can still use the app even when offline or if there are server issues.

## Customization

### Holds Positioning

The current implementation uses a grid of holds as an example. In a real application, you would want to map the holds to the actual positions on your spray wall image.

To customize the holds positions, modify the `initializeHolds` function in the `SprayWall.vue` component.

### Styling

The application uses SCSS for styling. You can customize the colors and other variables in the `src/assets/styles/main.scss` file.
