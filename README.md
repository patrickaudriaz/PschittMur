  - `router/` - Vue Router configuration
  - `services/` - API services
  - `assets/` - Static assets like styles and images

## Technologies Used

- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vite for fast development
- Vue Router for routing
- Pinia for state management
- SCSS for styling
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- Netlify Functions for serverless backend
- Axios for API requests

## Data Persistence

The application uses MongoDB Atlas for data persistence. This means:

1. Data is stored in a cloud database
2. Data is shared between all users
3. Data persists across different devices and browsers

The application also includes a localStorage fallback in case the MongoDB connection fails.

## Customization

### Holds Positioning

The current implementation uses a grid of holds as an example. In a real application, you would want to map the holds to the actual positions on your spray wall image.

To customize the holds positions, modify the `initializeHolds` function in the `SprayWall.vue` component.

### Styling

The application uses SCSS for styling. You can customize the colors and other variables in the `src/assets/styles/main.scss` file.
